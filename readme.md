# MD-2-HTML

A little Python script that uses a pre-built Windows executable of the 
[CommonMark reference implementation](https://github.com/jgm/cmark) to generate
a standalone, styled-HTML file.

User has the option to specify an alternative CSS stylesheet to bake into the
final HTML if the default, [Air](https://github.com/markdowncss/air), is not
satisfactory.
